## About the course 
(from the [course page](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4113#tab=omEmnet)) 

### Course content
The course provide experience in the design and implementation of computer programs that solve reasonably complex problems but require limited understanding of advanced theories and concepts in computer science. The focus is on bottom-up program development, and the use of modularity and abstraction for building large computational systems. I will learn to use relevant tools for program development, and I will gain useful experience for further study in computer science.

### Learning outcome
Basic knowledge in programming combined with planning and implementation of programming projects with some level of complexity. Basic skills in how to work structured and modularized towards a fully-functioning computer system. General competence in project work and independent development and programming.

### Learning methods and activities
The course is organized as a combination of individual assignments, project works in teams and lectures (the two projects this repo include). Presentations, reports and developed software is the basis for the assessment.
