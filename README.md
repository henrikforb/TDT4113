# TDT4113
Repository for the two group assignments in the subject TDT4113 - Programming Project at NTNU. Everything is written in object oriented Python

##Course content
The course provide experience in the design and implementation of computer programs that solve reasonably complex problems but require limited understanding of advanced theories and concepts in computer science. The focus will be on bottom-up program development, and the use of modularity and abstraction for building large computational systems. Students will learn to use relevant tools for program development, and they will gain useful experience for further study in computer science.

Learning outcome
Basic knowledge in programming combined with planning and implementation of programming projects with some level of complexity. Basic skills in how to work structured and modularized towards a fully-functioning computer system. General competence in project work and independent development and programming.

Learning methods and activities
Students will primarily carry out programming tasks both in and outside the lab. The course instructors and teaching assistants will spend many hours each week in the lab with the students. In some instances, traditional lectures will be given, but for most projects, the majority of instruction (both theoretical and practical) will occur in the lab. Students will work on individual assignments and have the option to work in small groups for some of the assignments.
The course is organized as a combination of individual assignments, project works in teams and lectures.
Presentations, reports and developed software is the basis for the assessment.


## Assignment KEYPAD

### Purpose:
• Learn to properly interpret signals from a simple keypad.
• Learn about Charlieplexed circuits.
• Learn the basics of a Finite State Machine (FSM) and its use as a controller.
• Gain experience integrating the keypad, Charlieplexer and FSM on the Raspberry Pi (R-Pi).
